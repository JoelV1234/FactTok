# FactTok

## 🤔 What is this sorcery?

Ever thought TikTok needed more random facts and fewer dancing teenagers? **SAME!** Welcome to FactTok, the app that makes you sound smart at parties you probably don't get invited to.

- ✅ Procrastinate productively
- ✅ Actually learn something while doom scrolling
- ✅ Impress your parents with random knowledge
- ✅ Finally understand Rick and Morty jokes
- ❌ No cringy dance challenges
- ❌ Zero beauty filters
- ❌ No "It's corn!" remixes

### Features That'll Blow Your Mind 🤯
- Over 100 interesting facts (like TikTok, but for people who read books)
- Save facts for later (to impress your crush with random knowledge)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack: The Building Blocks

### Core Framework
- **Flutter & Dart** - Because we like our apps like we like our facts: cross-platform and efficient
- **Provider pattern** - State management so clean it would make Marie Kondo proud

### Data
- **Dio** - HTTP client that fetches facts from **The Fact site**: https://www.thefactsite.com/
- **HTML Parser** - Scraping facts like a digital archaeologist
- **Firebase** (planned for future) - Because every app needs a little Google magic
  - Authentication (for your saved facts)
  - Cloud Firestore (where the facts live)
  - Analytics (to see how many minds we're blowing)
